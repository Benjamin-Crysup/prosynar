Contained in this folder are the raw data from the synthetic tests used to analyze the performance of prosynar.

test_str holds the results of the STR tests (the first pair of graphs in the supplement).
test_multstr holds the results of the adjacent STR tests (the second pair).
test_noise holds the results of the pure noise tests (the last pair).
	Note: this test needed to be done with a quick turnaround time, which is why only the runs of interest (LR threshold = 0) were performed.

The data from the actual sequence tests are limitted by IRB, and shall not be shared.
